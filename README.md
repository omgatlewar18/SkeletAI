## 🚀 Mission  

In forensic anthropology and post-disaster identification, determining gender from skeletal remains is a key step in restoring identity to victims.  
Traditional markers like the skull or pelvis are often unavailable — yet **hand bones remain more resilient**.  

**SkeletAI** bridges this gap using deep learning to estimate gender directly from hand X-rays, offering a **fast, reliable, and interpretable** solution for forensic experts and researchers.

## ✨ Key Features  

- 🧠 **High-Accuracy Model**  
  Built on **ResNet50** with transfer learning from ImageNet and fine-tuned on the **RSNA Bone Age dataset**, achieving robust performance through a two-stage training process.

- 🔍 **Explainable AI (XAI)**  
  Uses **Grad-CAM** heatmaps to visualize the bone regions (e.g., carpals, metacarpals) influencing predictions, enhancing interpretability and trust.

- 💻 **Interactive Web App**  
  Powered by **Streamlit**, providing a simple and intuitive interface — upload a hand X-ray, get an instant prediction with confidence scores.
